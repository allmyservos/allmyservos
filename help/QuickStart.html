		<h1>Quick Start</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>AllMyServos is a suite of tools for controlling a robot using the combination of a Raspberry Pi, Adafruit Servo Driver and MPU6050 gyro / accelerometer.</p>
		<p>This is the Graphical User Interface, there is a command line counterpart 'CLI.py' which can be found in the working directory.</p>
		<p>Services you choose to autostart in the GUI will also autostart with the CLI</p>
		<p>You can check the current working directory using: File -> System -> Information</p>
		<p>CLI.py can be run over SSH. This is one of the ways the robot can be controlled from a remote computer.</p>
		<h2>Specifications</h2>
		<p>Any set of instructions for a configuration of servos only make sense in the context of that specific configuration.</p>
		<p>For example, changing the channels into which the servos are wired would result in incorrect movements.</p>
		<p>For this reason, AllMyServos keeps track of changes to the current servo configuration, motions, chains, key mappings and IMU orientation.</p>
		<p>Specifications can also be packaged and exported to other copies of AllMyServos allowing a robot configuration to be cloned by exchanging a packaged file.</p>
		<p>Specifications also include a preview image of the blender armature and the blend file its self.</p>
		<p>View the current specification, list all specifications and install new ones using: File -> Specification</p>
		<h2>Servos</h2>
		<p>Servos can be configured by choosing: Servos -> Configure</p>
		<p>Add a servo for each channel of the servo driver and assign it a unique, human readable name.</p>
		<p>Once you have defined all required servos, the default pose can be fine tuned using: Servos -> Test</p>
		<p>Additionally you can supply bone information which can be used by a Blender armature</p>
		<h2>Motions</h2>
		<p>Motions are frames of instructions for the servos which will be executed at a specified rate (frames per second).</p>
		<h2>Chains</h2>
		<p>Chains allow you to define a series of motions which will be executed on this basis:</p>
		<p>Start: Generally starts in the default position and begins a movement</p>
		<p>Loop: Continues the start motion and ends in the same position, allowing it to be run repeatedly.</p>
		<p>End: When the chain is stopped, this motion is scheduled. It continues the loop motion and returns the robot to the default pose.</p>
		<h2>Keyboard</h2>
		<p>Use this to configure your keyboard to trigger motions or chains.</p>
		<p>A map is a collection of key mappings</p>
		<p>A key mapping is where you define what a key should do when pressed.</p>
		<p>If a key is mapped to a chain the loop motion will continue running while the key is pressed.</p>
		<p>When the key is released, the chain initiates the end motion and stops.</p>
		<p>The keyboard module is designed to work with TkInter and over SSH</p>
		<h2>Metrics</h2>
		<p>A crucial part of running experiments is being able to record your results. Metrics can be setup to collect any kind of information while the robot is running.</p>
		<p>Results are archived for later use and multiple past values can be stored in memory for comparisons during runtime.</p>
		<p>You can see a snapshot of the metrics your robot is currently monitoring by going to: Metrics -> Snapshot</p>
		<p>You can browse the historic values by going to: Metrics -> History</p>
		<p>The metric history displays archives in hour, minute, second and millisecond resolutions.</p>
		<h2>RPC</h2>
		<p>The Remote Procedure Call protocol allows remote commands to be sent from any device.</p>
		<p>This service is protected by 1024 bit encryption and requires a username and password.</p>
		<p>In addition, it lists all of the valid country codes for the SSL certificate and the exposed functions.</p>
		<p>Exposed functions are the methods within the 'Exposed' class which can be called by a remote computer.</p>
		<p>Further information about the service and access to the settings are available through: RPC -> Manage Server</p>
		<h2>Network</h2>
		<p>This allows your robot to collect information about computers connected to the local network.</p>
		<h2>IMU</h2>
		<p>This section is dedicated to the Gyro / Accelerometer.</p>
		<p>An IMU or Inertial Measuring Unit is a device, normally a printed circuit, which supplies information to a computer about its orientation and motion.</p>
		<p>All My Servos is based on the widely available MPU6050.</p>
		<p>IMU -> Orientation - Choose how data from the IMU should be interpreted in relation to the robot.</p>
		<p>IMU -> Sensor Data - This section displays all of the data that can be collected using the IMU.</p>
		<p>IMU -> Gravity - Visualizes the isolated effect of gravity according to the accelerometer.</p>
		<p>IMU -> Orthographic - This section has an orthographic representation of the robot. It allows the data collected from the IMU to be remapped to match the real roll, pitch and yaw.</p>
		<p>IMU -> Balance - This section allows rules to be configured for balancing. Starting the service will put the robot in the default position and attempt to maintain the angle based on the rules.</p>
		<h2>Schedule</h2>
		<p>All scheduled tasks are created using a generic thread which allows them to be managed using this section of the application.</p>
		<h2>Themes</h2>
		<p>Don't like the way the application looks? There's an interface for that! Go to: Settings -> Themes</p>
		<h2>All Settings</h2>
		<p>This section is for developers or advanced users only.</p>
		<p>Settings allow values used in the application to be manipulated easily. An interface is normally provided with the feature but in case it isn't, find it here.</p>
