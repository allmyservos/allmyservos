		<p>Use the following diagrams to connect an Adafruit servo driver and / or MPU6050 gyro and accelerometer</p>

		<p>Cabling needs to be created to connect the servo driver to the GPIO cable. One solution is to use salvaged parts.</p>
		<p>A salvaged cable from a PC power switch fits the pins on the servo driver.</p>

		<p>On the other end, the headers from an old motherboard can be used to create an interface.</p>

		<p>The MPU-6050 is mounted in the waist bracket of the robot in the image. A GPIO cable with individual connectors can plug directly into the IMU.</p>

		<p>Connect servos to the channels on the Adafruit servo driver</p>
		<p>The Adafruit servo servo driver requires a dedicated power supply. A 5v or 6v mains adapter or battery is recommended.</p>
		<p>4 AA cells can be used for experiments involving around 5 servos.</p>
		<p>A mains power supply which provides 5 - 6 volts, 1 - 3 amps can also be used to power the Adafruit servo driver.</p>
